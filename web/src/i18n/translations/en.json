    "title": "Frequently asked questions",
    "q1": {
      "question": "What problem does Aizen solve?",
      "answer": "Developers working on multiple branches typically juggle editor windows, terminal tabs, and browser windows. Aizen gives each worktree its own dedicated workspace — terminal, files, browser, agents — so you switch worktrees, not windows."
    },
    "q2": {
      "question": "What are Git worktrees?",
      "answer": "Git worktrees let you check out multiple branches simultaneously in separate directories. Unlike stashing or switching branches, each worktree is independent. You can build one branch while editing another."
    },
    "q3": {
      "question": "How is this different from VS Code or other editors?",
      "answer": "Editors focus on one project at a time. Aizen is built around worktrees — you manage multiple repos and branches in one window, each with its own terminal, browser, and agent session. It's a workspace for parallel development, not an editor."
    },
    "q4": {
      "question": "Which agents are supported?",
      "answer": "Aizen supports Claude, Codex (OpenAI), Gemini, Kimi, and any custom agent compatible with the Agent Client Protocol (ACP). Agents can be auto-installed from NPM or GitHub."
    },
    "q5": {
      "question": "Is Aizen free?",
      "answer": "Yes! Aizen is fully free and open source under the GPL-3.0 license. All features — workspaces, worktrees, agents, terminal, file browser, web browser, voice input — are included for free."
    },
    "q6": {
      "question": "What's Aizen Pro?",
      "answer": "Aizen Pro is a way to support continued development. Pro subscribers get priority support and will receive exclusive features as they're added. All current app features remain free — Pro is about keeping Aizen alive and growing. Available as monthly ($5.99/mo), yearly ($59/yr), or lifetime ($179)."
    },
    "q7": {
      "question": "Can I use one license on multiple Macs?",
      "answer": "Yes. Your Pro license can be activated on multiple Macs you own. Each device is registered to your license, and you can manage devices from the billing portal."
    },
    "q8": {
      "question": "What's the refund policy?",
      "answer": "We offer a 30-day money-back guarantee. If you're not satisfied, email dev@aizen.win within 30 days for a full refund, no questions asked."
    },
    "q9": {
      "question": "What are the requirements?",
      "answer": "macOS 13.5 Ventura or later. Apple Silicon and Intel Macs supported."
